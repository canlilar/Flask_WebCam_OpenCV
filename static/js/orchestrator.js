//import all dependencies
//Usually, we put a list of what to import in curly braces import {...}, like this:
// import {sayHi, sayBye} from './say.js'; 
// But if thereâ€™s a lot to import, we can import everything as an object using import * as <obj>, for instance:
// import * as say from './say.js'; 
// say.sayHi('John');
